# leaflet-challenge


In this challenge, we will be developing a way to visualize the earthquake data from The United States Geological Survey(USGS)

Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization

We get all Earthquackes from the past 7 days dataset from: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

The dataset come in a JSON format. We use the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for the visualization. 
We import and visualize the data by doing the following:

1. Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
2. 
3. Create data markers that reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color.
   Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
   
3. Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

4. Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
